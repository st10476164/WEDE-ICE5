## Reflection Prompt:
For my weather app I decided to make my daily forecast cards horizontally scrollable. My color scheme and design considerations revolutionalise weather app designing. We checked on youtube and found how to use openweather
to get a api key that makes my design realistic. I chose a modern and minimalistic color design.
